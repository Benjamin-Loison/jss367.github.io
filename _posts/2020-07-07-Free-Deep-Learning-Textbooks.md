There are a lot of great resources out there so I thought I would try to compile some of my favorites. This list contains books on deep learning, machine learning, and computer vision. These textbooks are all made freely available by the publisher.

## Deep Learning

* [Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/assets/deep-learning/Deep-Learning-with-PyTorch.pdf) by Eli Stevens, Luca Antiga, and Thomas Viehmann (2020) - Official textbook from the PyTorch team.

* [Deep Learning(https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville] (2015) - The most popular textbook in deep learning. Free in HTML form. There's not a PDF that you can simply download.

* [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html) by Michael Nielsen (2015) - This is also a book where there is no PDF of it. There are JavaScript elements in the text so it wouldn't work as well in PDF form anyway.

* [Dive into Deep Learning](http://d2l.ai/) by Aston Zhang, Zack C. Lipton, Mu Li,and  Alex J. Smola (2020)

* [First Contact With Deep Learning: Practical Introduction With Keras](https://torres.ai/first-contact-deep-learning-practical-introduction-keras/) by Jordi Torres (2018)

## General Machine Learning

* [Machine Learning Yearning](https://www.deeplearning.ai/machine-learning-yearning/) by Andrew Ng (2018) - this is more about the machine learning process and how to build projects. It's a short read. You have to provide an email address to download it. And while you're there I would recommend leaving the checkbox for signing up to receive his newsletter, The Batch, checked as well because it's a very good resource.

* [Interpretable Machine Learning: A Guide for Making Black Box Models Explainable](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/) by Christoph Molnar (2020)

## Computer Vision

* [Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications](http://szeliski.org/Book/drafts/SzeliskiBook_20100903_draft.pdf) by Richard Szeliski (2010) - The latest edition was published in 2010, so it predates the deep learning revolution.
