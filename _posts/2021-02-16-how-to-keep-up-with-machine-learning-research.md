I find it difficult to keep up with the latest in machine learning, even though it's part of my full-time job. Fortunately, there are a lot of resources out there to help sort through it all. I thought I would put together a list of resources that I use in case it helps anyone else. If you know of a great resource that I'm missing, please let me know!

## Websites

[Arxiv Sanity](http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/)

* My #1 place to find new research
* Be sure to create an account and start saving papers you like so the recommendation feature can work
* Site created by Andrej Karpathy

[Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/)
* The best site for seeing overall trends in the field
* Lots of new improvements that make this site better all the time
* There's also a newsletter (see below)

[Paper Digest](https://www.paperdigest.org/best-paper-digest/)
* Find the best papers from all the top conferences

[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/)
* Start with a paper you're interested in and see who cited it

[ConnectedPapers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/)
* Creates a graph of papers, so you can find research that is similar the initial paper
* I love the idea, although I haven't actually used the site much

## Newsletters

I'm not usually a newsletters guy, but for some reason I've found that there are excellent newsletters in the machine learning world. Here are the ones I use:

[The Batch](https://www.deeplearning.ai/thebatch/)
* Newsletter by Andrew Ng and his company, [deeplearning.ai](deeplearning.ai)
* Offers his thoughts on various hot topics, even if he is conspicuously anodyne
* Includes a mix of general ML news and research findings

[Import AI](https://jack-clark.net/)
* By Jack Clark of [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)
* Does a great job of highlighting the top papers of the week and gives good context for them as well
* [Subscribe here](https://us13.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=67bd06787e84d73db24fb0aa5&id=6c9d98ff2c)

[The Gradient](https://thegradientpub.substack.com/)
* Lots of good information on recent research

[Data Science Weekly](https://www.datascienceweekly.org/)

[Data Elixir](https://dataelixir.com/)
* One of my favorites

[Wild Week in AI](http://www.wildml.com/newsletter/)

[PapersWithCode](https://paperswithcode.com/newsletter/)


## YouTube

[Yannic Kilcher](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZHmQk67mSJgfCCTn7xBfew)
* Lots of videos, quite detailed paper reviews
* Most in the range of 20-60 minutes

[Two Minute Papers](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbfYPyITQ-7l4upoX8nvctg)
* Hold on to your papers because this guy is great
* Shortest videos (2-10 minutes) of them all

[Henry AI Labs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHB9VepY6kYvZjj0Bgxnpbw)
* Not as popular as some of the others but still really good content

[Arxiv Insights](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNIkB2IeJ-6AmZv7bQ1oBYg)
* Not many videos but the ones he has are excellent

[The AI Epiphany](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj8shE7aIn4Yawwbo2FceCQ)

## Textbooks

Recent textbooks can be a great place for learning the latest because they provide the necessary context. I've already written about textbooks so I'll just share the link to my [post on deep learning textbooks](https://jss367.github.io/free-deep-learning-textbooks.html).

## Podcasts

There are a lot of good podcasts about data science and machine learning. Unfortunately, they seem to come and go quickly. Some of my favorites are no longer active. Fortunately, there's a [website that tracks data science podcasts](https://dspods.netlify.app/) that is fairly exhaustive and generally kept up-to-date.

## Lectures

Sometimes I like to check out lectures to hear what I'm missing. Again, it's a good place to hear things in context. Here are some good ones.

[Deep Learning for Computer Vision at University of Michigan](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-TkQAfAZFbzxjBHtzdVCWE0Zbhomg7r)
* Taught by Justin Johnson, formerly of [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) fame

[fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/)
* The instructor of the courses, Jeremy Howard, sometime references recent research in the lectures

## Blogs

I don't find as many helpful machine learning blogs as I would like. I'm sure there are more out there so I'll expand this list when I come across them. Let me know your favorites.

<https://karpathy.github.io/>

<https://rubikscode.net/blog/>

<https://ruder.io/>

<https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/>

<https://veredshwartz.blogspot.com/>

## Twitter

Twitter is probably not the best place to find the latest in machine learning research, but sometimes it's worth it. Instead of listing a bunch of recommendations here, I'll just point you to a [link of who I follow on Twitter](https://twitter.com/JuliusSimonelli/following). I don't use Twitter much for anything else (or at all) so *most* of the people I follow are associated with ML.

## Reddit

I don't go to reddit much for finding the latest in ML, but you can definitely find stuff there. Here are some of the subreddits I've subscribed to.

[r/MachineLearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/)
* There's a weekly What Are You Reading (WAYR) pinned thread which can be good.

[r/computervision](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/)
* Not active as r/MachineLearning

There are some other subreddits but I don't use them very much.
