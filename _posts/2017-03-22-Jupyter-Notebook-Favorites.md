The Jupyter Notebook is a great tool for writing and exploring code as well as prototyping ideas. It's one of my favorite ways to write code, in part because of all the great features it has. This post demonstrates shows some of my favorite features.

# Jupyter Notebook extensions

One of the many great things about Jupyter Notebooks is the ability to add extensions.

## Installation

The easiest way to add Jupyter Notebook extensions is through nbextensions. You can install it using `conda-forge`:
```python
conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
```
You can also use `pip`:
```
pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
```
Then:
* Enter: `jupyter contrib nbextension install --user`
* Open up Jupyter Notebook and you will have a tab called Nbextensions
* Go to the Nbextensions tab and enable it from there

Now let's look at some of the extensions.

## [2to3 converter](http://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/code_prettify/README_2to3.html)

Converts Python 2 to Python 3 in a single click

## [Autopep8](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/code_prettify/README_autopep8.html)

Formats your code based on the PEP8 guide in a single click.

Install with `pip install autopep8`, then enable it.

## [spellchecker](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/spellchecker/README.html)

Does what you think it does.


# Shell Commands

You can also use shell commands inside Jupyter Notebooks. Some are built-in so you can type them directly, such as `ls` or `pwd`.


```python
pwd
```


    'C:\\Users\\Julius\\Google Drive\\JupyterNotebooks\\Blog'


To access other  shell commands, you will need to prefix them with a `!`. For example, you pip install directly from Jupyter Notebooks:

`!pip install numpy`

# Magic Commands

Jupyter Notebooks have another type of command known as _magic commands_. You can view all the magic commands by entering `%quickref` into your notebook, but here are some of my favorites:

## Display all your global variables with %whos

It's easy to lose track of your global variables, especially if you run your cells out of order. Fortunately, you can use the magic command `%whos` to display them all.

![whos]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/whos.png "Whos")

## Sharing Values with %store

You can use magic commands to store values in one notebook and load them in another. Here's an example:


```python
x = 5
```

Now you save it like so:


```python
%store x
```

    Stored 'x' (int)
    

And you can load it:


```python
%store -r x
```

## Running files with %run

You can use `%run my_file.py` to run a separate file.

## Measuring execution time with %timeit

You can use `%timeit` to see how long it takes your code to run.

# Debugging

Jupyter Notebooks have an amazing command for debugging. If you are running code and get an error, even if it's deep inside a function, you can type `%debug` into a cell and it will open up [ipdb](https://github.com/gotcha/ipdb) at the exact location the error occured with all the values as they were. It's amazing. Here's an example:


```python
def foo():
    soln = 'a' + 1
    return soln
```


```python
foo()
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-4-c19b6d9633cf> in <module>
    ----> 1 foo()
    

    <ipython-input-3-84285e1acb14> in foo()
          1 def foo():
    ----> 2     soln = 'a' + 1
          3     return soln
    

    TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str



```python
%debug
```

# Getting Help and Viewing Source Code 

Jupyter Notebooks have a lot of support for looking into code right from the notebook. Here are some examples.

## Command Palette

Jupyter Notebooks has a command palatte that you can access with Ctrl + Shift + P (Windows/Linux) / Cmd + Shift + P (Mac) (just like VSCode). From there you can search for whatever feature you're looking for.


## Shift + Tab

Shift + Tab is a great keyboard shortcut that every Jupyter Notebook user should know. You simply start to call a function and when you're inside the parentheses and can't remember the right inputs, hit Shift + Tab and it will show you the documentation. If you hit Tab multiple times while holding Shift it cycles through various displays of the documentation. Try it out!

## Question Marks

You can put a question mark behind any function or class to pull up the docstring. It creates a pop-up from the bottom of the screen, so you won't be able to see it in this post, but here's an example.


```python
def func_with_docstring():
    """
    This is a useful docstring
    """
    return 1
```


```python
func_with_docstring?
```

Even better than that, just put two question marks behind something to view the source code.


```python
func_with_docstring??
```

This shows you the docstring as before but then **the entire code**. Amazing!

Also If you just wanted to see the docstring, you could call `help`. This prints the docstring, so you'll be able to see it in this case.


```python
help(func_with_docstring)
```

    Help on function func_with_docstring in module __main__:
    
    func_with_docstring()
        This is a useful docstring
    
# Widgets

You can build beautiful and functional widgets right into your notebooks with [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This is such a great tool to really add some power to your notebooks.


# Converting to other formats with nbconvert

Convert Jupyter Notebooks to various formats, including HTML, LaTeX, PDF, and Markdown

`jupyter nbconvert --to html mynotebook.ipynb`

or 

`jupyter nbconvert --to markdown mynotebook.ipynb`

See how I use it to [prepare Jupyter Notebooks for my blog](https://jss367.github.io/jupyter-notebooks-in-blog.html).

# Little Tricks

## Splitting Cells

One hot key that I like but sometimes forget is how to split a cell where my cursor is. So I just open up the command palatte and type in "split" and I see that it is Ctrl + Shift + - (Windows/Linux) Cmd + Shift + - (Mac).

## Printing LaTeX

Jupyter Notebooks use MathJax to render LaTeX in Markdown. To add LaTeX, simply surround your statement with `$$`:

$$c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$$

Some things that work in Jupyter Notebooks don't work with the renderer I use for this blog, so I can't show everything. But in Jupyter Notebooks you can use LaTeX with a single `$` and use a double `$$` to center it the expression.
