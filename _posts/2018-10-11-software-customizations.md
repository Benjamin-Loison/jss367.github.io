## Sublime Text

#### External Packages

Sublime Text has a great ecosystem of packages and plugins. Here's how to open the package manager:
* `cmd` + `shift` + `p`

###### Package

Here are some packages that I like
* https://packagecontrol.io/packages/FileDiffs



#### Tabs

I don't like the way Sublime handles tabs, so I change it to make it more like Chrome. To do this, you'll need to edit your key bindings. Here's how you do that:

* (Windows or Linux) Preferences -> Key Bindings
* (Mac) Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Key Bindings

Then add this to the file:
```
{ "keys": ["ctrl+tab"], "command": "next_view" },
{ "keys": ["ctrl+shift+tab"], "command": "prev_view" }
```
#### Markdown Files

I don't particularly like the way Sublime handles markdown files by default, so I change them. The exact menu location will depend on your operation system, but they're not too different.
* On a Mac, go into Preferences -> Settings -> Syntax Specific (Mac)
* On Linux, go into Preferences -> Settings - Syntax Specific

add this:
```
{
	"color_scheme": "Monokai.sublime-color-scheme",
	"draw_centered": false,
	"line_numbers": true,
	"gutter": true,
}
```
Here's another option:
```
{
	"color_scheme": "Packages/Monokai Extended/Monokai Extended.tmTheme",
	"dictionary": "Packages/Language - English/en_US.dic",
	"ignored_packages":
	[
		"Markdown",
		"Vintage"
	],
	"line_numbers": true,
	"show_full_path": true,
	"spell_check": true,
	"theme": "Adaptive.sublime-theme"
}
```
I always install these extensions:
* [Monokai Extended](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/sublime-monokai-extended)
* [Markdown Extended](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/sublime-markdown-extended)

For theme I do adaptive

Color scheme is monokai-extended

You'll want to make sure you used markdown-extended:
View -> Syntax -> Markdown Extended
but this only applies it to one file.

## Terminator

I customize Terminator to make it more like iTerm2. To customize it, you'll need to right click on the window then select "Preferences". Then go into Keybindings.
Here are some things I like to change:
* close_term
* new_window
* split_horiz
* split_vert

## VSCode

I did the same thing with tabs in VSCode.

### Make Tabs Work Like Chrome

I don't like the default behavior of tab cycling in VSCode because it switches tabs in order of most recently used, which I never remember. I prefer it to work like tabbing in Chrome, which is far more intuitive to me. Fortunately, VSCode lets you customize this. To change this, you'll need to edit your `keybindings.json` file like so:
* Open Command Palette
* Search for "Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)"
* Open the file and add this to the file:
```
[
    {
        "key": "ctrl+tab",
        "command": "workbench.action.nextEditorInGroup"
    },
    {
        "key": "ctrl+shift+tab",
        "command": "workbench.action.previousEditorInGroup"
    }
]
```

The ones you're look for are `workbench.action.nextEditor` and `workbench.action.previousEditor`.
