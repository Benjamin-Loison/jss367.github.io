In this post, I'll talk about how I set up my shell and environment. I Use Windows, Mac, and Linux on a daily basis, so I have different setups for different purposes, but I try to make them similar when I can.

I use [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) as my main shell. It's now the default shell on Macs and I think deservedly so. I use [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) to configure it and highly recommend it.

I store all of my environment variables in a `~/.profile` file. Then I source that file in whatever shell I'm using. This makes it much easier to work across a variety of environments.

## My .profile Setup

* I usually share my `.profile` with others in my company (or wherever I am) so that we can all share shortcuts. In order to do this without sharing passwords, I make a separate file called something like `.my_credentials` and export my credentials from there.

### Functions

```bash
alias ..='cd ..' # these aren't needed anymore
alias ...='cd ../../../'
alias ....='cd ../../../../'

# git
alias gs='git status'

```

## conda init

This whole thing exists because for conda to fully work it needs to be initialized and activated. That's what this code block is doing.

Let's do over what the conda init command does

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then

`$?` is a variable that is equal to the return value of the last command you ran. This is often a return code, which is 0 for a success and non-zero if there's been an error. SO this line is saying, if the last command ran successfully, then...


## My .zshrc

Conda will install the initialization script for conda inside `.zshrc` (for Macs). It usually looks like one of the following (depending on whether you use Anaconda or Miniconda): 

```
# >>> conda initialize >>>
# !! Contents within this block are managed by 'conda init' !!
__conda_setup="$('/bin/conda' 'shell.bash' 'hook' 2> /dev/null)"
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    eval "$__conda_setup"
else
    if [ -f "/home/jsimonelli/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh" ]; then
        . "/home/jsimonelli/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh"
    else
        export PATH="/home/jsimonelli/miniconda3/bin:$PATH"
    fi
fi
unset __conda_setup
# <<< conda initialize <<<
```

```
# >>> conda initialize >>>
# !! Contents within this block are managed by 'conda init' !!
__conda_setup="$('/home/julius/anaconda3/bin/conda' 'shell.bash' 'hook' 2> /dev/null)"
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    eval "$__conda_setup"
else
    if [ -f "/home/julius/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh" ]; then
        . "/home/julius/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh"
    else
        export PATH="/home/julius/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"
    fi
fi
unset __conda_setup
# <<< conda initialize <<<
```

It's fine to keep in there, but if you use `tmux`, you might run into a problem. `tmux` doesn't source `.zshrc` - it only sources `.profile`, so conda won't load in a tmux window. Even worse, it may pull Python from `/usr/bin/python`, which will be old Python 2 (use `which python` to see which python is being used). So you might want to cut and paste the initialization over to .profile.

I have found that if I don't include `conda activate $DEFAULT_CONDA_ENVIRONMENT` in my `.zshrc`, it doesn't activate my default profile, even though I have this in my `.profile`. So I leave it in `.zshrc`.

Other stuff is added to `.zshrc` automatically as well. Things like `[ -f ~/.fzf.zsh ] && source ~/.fzf.zsh` automatically get added here. If you don't need it for `tmux`, you can leave it here. Otherwise I would recommend moving it all over to `.profile`.

## Oh My Zsh Configuration

* I usually leave the theme as `ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"`

* Then I create a profile and put in it `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/profile.zsh`

* That profile just says `source ~/.profile`

## Bash

I still use Bash fairly often, and because it doesn't come with all the same aliases that Oh My Zsh does, I have to add some of the most important ones manually. Here are some I recommend.

```
alias ff='find . -name'
alias findpy='find . -name "*.py" | xargs grep --color'
alias grep='grep --color=auto'
alias hgrep='history | grep -v grep | grep '
alias ll='ls -GlAFh'
alias lls='ls -GlAFhS'
alias ..='cd..'
alias ...='cd../..'
```

```
alias gs='git status'

#redo last command but with sudo
please='sudo $(history -p !!)'

wgpu='watch -d -n 0.5 gpustat' # requires gpustat
ns='watch -d -n 0.5 nvidia-htop.py

nb='jupyter notebook --port=8888 --no-browser --ip=0.0.0.0 ==allow-root --NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit=1000000000'
```

```
# reload user profile
alias rp='source ~/.profile'
alias rld='source ~/.bashrc' #reload

# better ls (column detail and no meta-files (., .., etc))
alias ls='ls -lA'

alias showpath='echo $PATH | tr ":" "\n"'
```

conda activate "$DEFAULT_CONDA_ENVIRONMENT"
 
color git branch:
```
parse_git_branch() {
     git branch 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/(\1)/'
}
export PS1="\u@\h \[\e[32m\]\w \[\e[91m\]\$(parse_git_branch)\[\e[00m\]$ "
```

```
# enable color support of ls and also add handy aliases
if [ -x /usr/bin/dircolors ]; then
    test -r ~/.dircolors && eval "$(dircolors -b ~/.dircolors)" || eval "$(dircolors -b)"
    alias ls='ls --color=auto'
    #alias dir='dir --color=auto'
    #alias vdir='vdir --color=auto'

    alias grep='grep --color=auto'
    alias fgrep='fgrep --color=auto'
    alias egrep='egrep --color=auto'
fi
```

```
# some more ls aliases
alias ll='ls -alF'
alias la='ls -A'
alias l='ls -CF'
```
I also like to customize the git prompt if it's not already done for me. Here's one I like:

```
parse_git_branch() {
     git branch 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/(\1)/'
}
# customize the zsh prompt
PS1='%B%F{green}%(?.%F{green}âˆš.%F{red}X:%?) %B%F{251} %1~ $(parse_git_branch)\ %# '
```

## Alias Notes

If you make a shortcut to your code base like so:

`export BASE='$HOME/git'`

then if you want to use it an an alias you'll have to use double quotes.

Instead of `alias cdh=cd $BASE'` you'll have to use `alias cdh="cd $BASE"`

However, if you were just doing it with `$HOME`, it seems single quotes work.


## Useful Git Commands

These are good to set to an alias

`git log --pretty=format:'%C(yellow)%h %Cred%ad %Cblue%an%Cgreen%d %Creset%s' --date=short`


Testing:
```
# set a fancy prompt (non-color, unless we know we "want" color)
case "$TERM" in
    xterm-color|*-256color) color_prompt=yes;;
esac
```

 ## Windows
 
 For Windows, I sometimes use [Ubuntu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) as my command line. I do this because it's easiest for me to stick with Unix commands if I'm bouncing around between systems so much. In general, I try to run my Windows like a Linux system when I'm working with the command line a lot.
