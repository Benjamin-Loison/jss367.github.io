I find that sometimes the best way to understand a topic is to see it in action. That can be tricky for some topics, like computer vision and deep learning, so I created this page to aggregate some of my favorite visualizations in these fields. I hope to continuously add to this page. Let me know if you have any suggestions for what really made an idea click for you!


* [Hands-on demonstration of how image kernels work](https://setosa.io/ev/image-kernels/)
* [Beautiful step-by-step process of matrix multiplication](matrixmultiplication.xyz)
* [The Standford CS231n webpage](https://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/) shows how convolutional neural networks work very clearly
* [Distill](https://distill.pub/) is an online journal for presenting machine learning research in a clear way. There is a lot of great content here.
