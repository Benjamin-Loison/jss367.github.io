strategy

- this could be replaced by a simple lambda function



which design patterns are most relevant for machine learning?

The Strategy pattern suggests that you take a class that does something specific in a lot of different ways and extract all of these algorithms into separate classes called strategies.


Three main types of patterns:

creation patterns - how to create objects

structural patterns - how to find objects and classes into a larger structure

behavioral patterns - how to assign resposbility between objects


## bridge

split classes into two separate sets - abstraction and implementation


what to do when you have two inpedendent dimensions of an objects (e.g. shape and color of an object)
