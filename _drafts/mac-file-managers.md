# commander one


## Commands

### Go up a folder:
page up, then enter



### sort by date modified




### jump to folder




### Pain Points

Search for even simple commands is slow

Problem is can't click and drag a file into a folder easily

deselect files
hold command and click on them to deselect
* not easy to do with many of them
* There's no way to just click away and deselect them all


See what changes you've made - there is a reset to defaults option, but you don't know what it will do


can't expand preferences window to see more of your hot keys



flip through images

I prefer being able to click on the path at the top to get the path, but you can't. (Like you can in Windows)
But if you want to copy the path, you can right click and select copy path to clipboard.
