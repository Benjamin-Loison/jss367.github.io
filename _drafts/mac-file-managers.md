# commander one


## Commands

### Go up a folder:
page up, then enter



### sort by date modified




### jump to folder




### Pain Points

Search for even simple commands is slow

Problem is can't click and drag a file into a folder easily

deselect files
hold command and click on them to deselect
* not easy to do with many of them
* There's no way to just click away and deselect them all


See what changes you've made - there is a reset to defaults option, but you don't know what it will do


can't expand preferences window to see more of your hot keys



flip through images

I prefer being able to click on the path at the top to get the path, but you can't. (Like you can in Windows)
But if you want to copy the path, you can right click and select copy path to clipboard.

how to scroll through images?


you can scroll through images in finder that you open from finder, but not if you open them from commander one
for commander one, you need to change your default image viewer to pixea


to do that, you need to hit option when you right click. then you can select "get finder info"

then go to "Open with"


go up one folder is command + up arrow



Deselecting files doesn't happen automatically. Instead, you have to do command - to deselect all files




for image viewers. i recommend xee. you'll have to change the default values though

pixea is good but has permission issues - always have to grant new permissions for each new folder
