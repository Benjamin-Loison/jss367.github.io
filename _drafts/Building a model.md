Building a model


overfit first

- make sure your model is capable of solving the task

then make it overfit less

1. more data
2. data augmentation
3. Generalizable archtecture - more batch norm, densenets
4. regularlization - weight decay, dropout
5. reduce architecture complexity if nothing else works - less layers, less activations
