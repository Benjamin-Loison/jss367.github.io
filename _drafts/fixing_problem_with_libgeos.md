Sometimes you get a problem with not being able to find `libgeos_c.dylib`. It's used in shapely and can be difficult.

First, check if it's installed. If you think you installed it with homebrew, you can try this:

```
find /opt/homebrew/ -name "libgeos_c.dylib" 2>/dev/null
```
If you have no idea, search everywhere:

```
find / -name "libgeos_c.dylib" 2>/dev/null
```
If you installed it with homebrew, you might find it here: `/opt/homebrew/lib/libgeos_c.dylib`

If it's not, `brew install geos`

# Path

Then check that it's in the path. You should see `/opt/homebrew/lib`

Here's what each of the directories you've listed typically contains:

/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin: This contains the LLVM executables. LLVM is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies. If you're doing work related to compilers, or certain kinds of development work, you might need this in your PATH.

/opt/homebrew/bin: This is the primary place Homebrew installs executables. This should almost certainly be in your PATH if you're using Homebrew.

/opt/homebrew/sbin: This contains "system" binaries that are typically used for system maintenance and administration. You usually need this in your PATH if you're doing system administration tasks.

/opt/homebrew/lib: This is where Homebrew installs libraries, including dynamic libraries like libgeos_c.dylib. While it's not common to put library directories in your PATH (which is generally used for executables), in some cases it might be necessary for dynamic libraries.


Since you're dealing with a problem related to a dynamic library not being found, you might find it helpful to add /opt/homebrew/lib to a different environment variable, DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, which is used by the dynamic linker on macOS. You can do this in a similar way to how you modify the PATH:

```bash
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
```


If something's working in one environment and not the other:

```python
import sys
print(sys.path)
```



If you keep runnning into errors like:
```
OSError: dlopen(/Users/julius/opt/anaconda3/envs/all/lib/libgeos_c.dylib, 0x0006): tried: '/Users/julius/opt/anaconda3/envs/all/lib/libgeos_c.dylib' (no such file), '/System/Volumes/Preboot/Cryptexes/OS/Users/julius/opt/anaconda3/envs/all/lib/libgeos_c.dylib' (no such file), '/Users/julius/opt/anaconda3/envs/all/lib/libgeos_c.dylib' (no such file)
```

You might want to install GEOS within your conda environment where Shapely is installed. You can do this with the following command:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge geos
```
This should install GEOS in the lib directory of your active conda environment, and Shapely should be able to locate it when it's imported.
