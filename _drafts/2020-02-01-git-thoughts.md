git blame should be git credit


problems with git

git checkout is overloaded
git checkout -b to create a new branch
git checkout . should be git clear or something

it's too easy for a new user to get in a detached head state
is it too much to read all the  documentation? honestly, I think it is. for a  beginner user that's a lot and unlikely to happen



There are two many different workflows to get to the same place. You can find someone who has the exact same goals are you doing different commands, and can't find out which one is right.
