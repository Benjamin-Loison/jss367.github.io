not everything should be expressed as a meanBy doing it you are implicitly saying "This is a meaningful representation of the data". It's NOT
life expectancy
- the difference is child mortality, not 40 years living to be 60- means are good for some distributions, like gaussian and uniform, but they're not good for changing distributions.
take the mean of a controversial movie, where half the ratings are 10 and the other half are 0
- inconvenient truth



Don't take the mean - glasses of water

8 glasses of water (or 64 ounces) came from a study that showed that it was average. It definitely didn't show that people who drink less are hurting their health in some way. I'm yet to find any evidence that the average person should be drinking water even when they're not thirsty.
