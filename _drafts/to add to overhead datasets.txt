To add to overhead datasets:

image sizes 
* max
* min
* histogram of shapes


Add example images!!!



Training example frequency is low versus other disciplines. Few datasets exist that have appropriate labels
for objects within satellite imagery. The most notable
are: SpaceNet [38], A Large-scale Dataset for Object
DeTection in Aerial Images (DOTA) [40], Cars Overhead With Context (COWC) [27], and xView [18].

This post focuses on object detection datasets.


The xView Dataset [18] was chosen for the application of super-resolution techniques and the quantification
of object detection performance. Imagery consists of 1,415
km2 of DigitalGlobe WorldView-3 pan-sharpened RGB imagery at 30 cm native GSD resolution spread across 56 distinct global locations and 6 continents (sans Antarctica).
The labeled dataset for object detection contains 1 million object instances across 60 classes annotated with bounding boxes, including various types of buildings, vehicles,
planes, trains, and boats.
Unfortunately, many objects are
mislabeled or simply missed by labelers (see Figure 1).
In addition, many xView classes have a very
low number of training examples (e.g. Truck w/Liquid
has only 149 examples) that are poorly differentiated from
similar classes (e.g. Truck w/Box has 3653 examples and
looks very similar to Truck w/Liquid).



Datasets like TAS [9], VEDAI [24], COWC [20] and DLR 3K Munich Vehicle [15] only focus on vehicles. UCAS-AOD [39] contains vehicles and planes while HRSC2016 [17] only contains ships even though fine-grained category information are given. 

what to judge a dataset on:
 1) a large
number of images, 2) many instances per categories, 3) properly oriented object annotation, and
4) many different classes of objects, which make it approach to real-world applications.

DOTA
- is there a variety of shapes?
- boxes are arbitrary quadrilateral


NWPUVHR
- annotated by experts


DIOR - object DetectIon in Optical Remote sensing images

"DIOR" is a large-scale benchmark data set proposed for object detection in optical remote sensing images
 


Other notes:

Currently no pixel level overhead imagery datasets for object detection

## UCAS-AOD
This is a dataset by the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences

Here's the website: https://ucassdl.cn/
2 categories: Airplanes, Vehicles
910

UCAS-AOD contains 1,510 satellite images (≈ 700 × 1300 px) with 14,595 objects annotated by OBBs for two categories:. The dataset was randomly split into 1,110 training and 400 testing images.
