# General Machine Learning

* [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - The #1 place to go for your shallow learning needs. No support for GPUs but does everything else

* [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - If you're particularly interested in gradient boosting, which is one of the top performing shallow learning algorithms, definite check this one out


# Graphing

* Matplotlib - The default. It's the most common and my go-to. I would say the API is intuitive, but there are enough other people asking the same questions that there's a lot of support out there.

* Seaborn - Built on top of Matplotlib

* Plotly - Another good option, especially for interactive graphs
