Let's say you have three conda environments: `py2`, `py3_env1` and `py3_env2`. You activate `py3_env1` and then started a Jupyter Notebook in your environment. You start a notebook and everything looks right. But when you try to import packages that you *know* are in `py3_env1`, they are missing. Confused, you check which environment you're in.

`!conda env list`

    # conda environments:
    #
    base                     /opt/conda
    py2                      /opt/conda/envs/py2
    env1                  *  /opt/conda/envs/py3_env1
    env2                     /opt/conda/envs/py3_env2

This looks fine. So you check to see what interpreter you're using

    import sys
    print(sys.executable)

it says

`/opt/conda/envs/py3_env2/bin/python`

What? Why is it using the py3_env2 python interpreter? The answer is kernels.


Let's step back a second to how they were created. There are a lot of different ways to find yourself in this situation, but for our purposes we'll assume you're in a Docker container and did something like this:

    # Create the environments
    RUN conda env create -f py2.yaml
    RUN conda env create -f py3_env1.yaml
    RUN conda env create -f py3_env2.yaml
    
    # Install the IPython kernel
    RUN /bin/bash -c "conda init bash && source /root/.bashrc && conda activate env1 && conda install -y notebook ipykernel && ipython kernel install --user && conda deactivate"
    RUN /bin/bash -c "conda init bash && source /root/.bashrc && conda activate env1 && conda install -y notebook ipykernel && ipython kernel install --user && conda deactivate"
    RUN /bin/bash -c "conda init bash && source /root/.bashrc && conda activate env2 && conda install -y notebook ipykernel && ipython kernel install --user && conda deactivate"

OK, let's jump back to debugging.

The next thing you'll need to do is look at your jupyter kernels:

`cd /root/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/`

`ls`

`python2  python3`

Two kernels. You have one for python 2 and one for python 3

When you look inside

`cat python3/kernel.json`

You see

{
 "argv": [
  "/opt/conda/envs/py3_env2/bin/python",
  "-m",
  "ipykernel_launcher",
  "-f",
  "{connection_file}"
 ],
 "display_name": "Python 3",
 "language": "python"
}

Why is the python 3 kernel only using the `py3_env2` environment? 

So you have two environments sharing the python 3 kernel

You can now change the kernel by selecting "Kernel" in the file menu, then "Change kernel".


Install the IPython kernel:

pip install --user ipykernel


There is a kernel.json file

If you don't get your env a name it will overwrite this

What happened is that the py3_enf2 kernel overwrote the py3_env1 kernel. 



For Windows users, you can go in the Anacoda Prompt

jupyter kernelspec list

Should see something like C:\Users\Julius\anaconda3\share\jupyter\kernels\python3

cd there

then there's a kernel.json with this:
```
{
 "argv": [
  "C:/Users/Julius/anaconda3\\python.exe",
  "-m",
  "ipykernel_launcher",
  "-f",
  "{connection_file}"
 ],
 "display_name": "Python 3",
 "language": "python"
}
```



Manually add them:


python -m ipykernel install --user --name myenv --display-name "Python (myenv)"
python -m ipykernel install --user --name pyt --display-name "PyTorch FasiAI"
python -m ipykernel install --user --name pt --display-name "pt"




# Debugging tools:
These are repeated from above
## 
import sys
sys.executable

Should say something like:

/opt/conda/envs/my_env/bin/python

## From within a notebook, see what environment I'm using
`!conda env list`


jupyter kernelspec list
